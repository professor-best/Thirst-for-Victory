NCAA March Madness Corporate Sponsor Research

Abstract: This study investigates the potential impact of sponsorship by major beverage companies, specifically Coca-Cola and Pepsi, on the performance of college basketball teams during the March Madness tournament. With the prevalence of corporate sponsorship in collegiate athletics, understanding its influence on team dynamics and competitive outcomes is of particular interest. Utilizing data from the 2024 season, including team sponsorships and tournament results, we analyze whether there exists a significant correlation between a college's beverage sponsor and its performance in the March Madness Tournament. This research contributes to the broader discourse on the intersection of corporate sponsorship and sports performance, shedding light on the potential implications for both athletic programs and corporate partners.
